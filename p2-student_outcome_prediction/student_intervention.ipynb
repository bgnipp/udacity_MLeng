    "- **Based on the experiments you performed earlier, in 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors what single model you chose as the best model. Which model is generally the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance?**\n",
    "  - Of the three models evaluated above, the Support Vector Classification model is probably the best choice:\n",
    "    - It performs well with limited training data.  Surprisingly, it performs better when trained on the 200 sample training set vs. the 300 sample training set.\n",
    "    - Though the training time is higher than that of the other evaluated models, it is still quite low (it took 3ms to train on 200 samples).  The cost of this compute time is quite negligible (we're talking micropennies).\n",
    "    - The prediction time is 1ms (on my laptop).  This is greater than the that of the other evaluated models (which clock in closer to 0ms).  However, in almost all concievable circumstances, a 1ms prediction time would significantly exceed minimum requirements (it could make 30,000 predictions in the time it took to write this bullet :)\n",
    "    -  It performs better than any other model when evaluted by the F1 metric, by a margin of about 2%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors in layman's terms how the final model chosen is supposed to work (for example if you chose a Decision Tree or Support Vector Machine, how does it make a prediction).**\n",
    "  - The SVC model essentially graphs training data, and attempts to \"draw a line\" on this graph to separate the data into the distinct classes we are trying to distinguish/predict.  In our case, our data consists of multiple 'features' (student data fields/columns), and this results in a graph with many dimensions. Bear with me; graphs of greater than three dimensions are difficult to visualize, but they can be very useful, especially in this case.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "    The SVC model then finds a line (or \"plane\") on this graph which provides the best separation between classes (in our case, students who passed vs. students who failed).  The model takes extra care to find a line that maximizes the space between itself and the data classes it is separating.  It focuses on distinguishing the points that are most difficult to tell apart.  The idea is that if the model is good at making the most challenging distinctions, it should also be able to make less challenging distinctions with ease.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    After the the line is drawn (i.e. the \"model is trained\"), the model makes predictions by plotting new data against the graph and seeing which \"side of the line/plane\" the point falls on, which indicates which class it belongs to.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fine-tune the model. Use Gridsearch with at least one important parameter tuned and with at least 3 settings. Use the entire training set for this.**\n",
    "  - Done\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is the model's final F<sub>1</sub> score?**\n",
    "  - 0.9252 (against the training set), and 0.8465 (against the test set).  The performance against the test set is significantly better than the untuned model, but the performance against the test slight is slightly worse!  We may be overfitting a bit by tuning the model against the training data. "
